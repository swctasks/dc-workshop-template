<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. 
</p>
<p>
We will cover {{page.day1_am}}, {{page.day1_pm}}, {{page.day2_am}} and {{page.day2_pm}}.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
</p>

<!--

  This block displays the address and links to maps showing directions
  if the latitude and longitude of the workshop have been set.  You

  ETHERPAD

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

{% if page.etherpad %}
<p>
  <strong>Etherpad:</strong> <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">{{page.etherpad}}</a>.
  <br/>
  We will use this Etherpad for chatting, taking notes, and sharing URLs and bits of code.

<!--
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
